This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction 

This project is part of my university, and it is the required to get my degree. The app is a simple news paper web app where you can create an account, start liking some news articles and then it will show you recommendations based on the articles you liked. 



the entire project was developed by using the following technologies: 

*  **ReactJs**: main library to build web views based on components. 
* **Apollo-react:** to fetch data from the server/backend which is a graphql server implemented using DJango/python. 
* **Material-UI:** main UI library to create simple components based on Material design. 



the structure of the project is the following: 

* **views:** represent each view of the web app as a set of components.
* **components:** the components that are part of the web app.
* **tests:** unit tests suites using jest as the testing framework.
